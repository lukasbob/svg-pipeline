# SVG pipeline test

Use svg-sprite via gulp to generate output in various forms for test purposes.
Also adds a generator for creating arbitrary templated content based on the list of SVG assets, using Handlebars templates.

Blast off like so:
```
npm install && gulp
```
 Puts stuff in `out` directory. Look around and see what you find.
